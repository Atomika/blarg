# Destiny 2: Beyond Light ARG
**What we know so far**.

The [Collector's Edition (CE) of Beyond Light](https://eu.bungiestore.com/collections/collectors-edition/products/preorder-destiny-2-beyond-light-collectors-edition-no-game-code) contains the following items: a bag, a canteen, a soundtrack CD, a sticker, a postcard, a letter/report, a "mysterious logbook" and a statue of a pyramid ship.

Out of these, we have found things of interest on the postcard, the letter/report, the pyramid and the logbook.

### Emblem Codes
Most of the puzzles so far have resulted in emblem codes. There is also one emblem code that is unique to owners of the CE.

#### (CE Owners Only) The postcard
There is a code printed on the postcard which is _single use_ and unique for each postcard. It can be redeemed on [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem)

#### (Everyone) The Tube/Rod Puzzle
There are tubes/rods several places. Page 14. Page 27. Page 14 contains the code for the puzzle: match rods of the same length on page 27 and write the corresponding letters from top to bottom. The sequence of rods of length 9 is a code for an emblem: XXX-XXX-XXX (Redeem at [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem))
